                handle information about you and your health when you use the Service, whether as an individual
                patient or as a caregiver or patient advocate managing someone else's information.

            <p class="mb-3">
                This Privacy Policy applies to information we handle in connection with the Veritell application and
                any associated services we provide directly. It does not apply to:

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    Your healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, doctors), the MyChart portal, or any other patient
                    portals, which have their own privacy policies and legal obligations;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Third-party services that you access through links or integrations from the Service.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                You should review the privacy policies of your Providers and any portals you connect to Veritell to
                understand how they handle your information.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">3. Types of information we handle</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Because Veritell is designed as a patient-hosted application with local storage, it is helpful to
                distinguish between:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-2">
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">"Personal Data"</span> – information that identifies or can reasonably
                    be linked to you as an individual (such as your name or email address); and
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">"Health Data"</span> – information about your physical or mental
                    health, medical history, test results, diagnoses, or care, including data that may be considered
                    Protected Health Information ("PHI") under U.S. law.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-4">3.1 Account and contact information</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-1">
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
                <li>Account identifiers or subscription status</li>
                <li>Basic settings and preferences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-4">3.2 Billing and transaction information</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                If you purchase a subscription or other paid features, our payment processors may collect
                billing-related information such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-1">
                <li>Billing name and contact details</li>
                <li>Payment method details (e.g., card type, last 4 digits)</li>
                <li>Transaction dates and amounts</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                Payment details are typically handled directly by our third-party payment providers; we do not store
                full payment card numbers on our own systems.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-4">3.3 Device, diagnostics, and usage information</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                To keep the Service secure and reliable, we may collect limited technical information, such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-1">
                <li>Device type, operating system, and app version</li>
                <li>Logs or error reports (for example, when a sync or summary fails)</li>
                <li>
                    Basic usage metrics (such as feature usage, performance, or frequency of sync events)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                Where practicable, we aim to configure diagnostics so that they do not include raw Health Data or
                other unnecessary personal details.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-4">3.4 Health Data stored on your device</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                When you connect Veritell to your MyChart or other patient portal, the application can store and
                process Health Data such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-1">
                <li>Lab and test results and associated details</li>
                <li>Clinical notes and visit summaries</li>
                <li>Diagnostic codes, medications, and care plans</li>
                <li>
                    AI-generated summaries, explanations, and "master overviews" derived from your records
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Consistent with how we have designed the Service, this Health Data is intended to be stored in an
                encrypted data store on your device and accessed locally by the app.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                By default and where technically feasible, we design the Service so that this Health Data remains on
                your device and is not transmitted to our servers without your explicit choice to use an online
                feature that requires it.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Providing and maintaining the Service</span> – to run the application,
                    facilitate sync with your portals, generate AI-based summaries, manage your subscription, and keep
                    your local data usable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Communicating with you</span> – to send service-related messages such as
                    onboarding guidance, feature updates, or subscription notices.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Security and reliability</span> – to detect, investigate, and prevent
                    fraudulent or malicious activity and to maintain the integrity of the Service.

                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Improving the Service</span> – to understand how features perform,
                    troubleshoot issues, and inform product improvements, generally using aggregated, de-identified, or
                    non-Health Data where possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Legal and compliance</span> – to comply with applicable legal
                    obligations, enforce our Terms of Use, and protect our rights and the safety of users.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                For U.S. users, these purposes align with common concepts such as providing the service you request,
                ensuring security, and meeting legal obligations.

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-1">5.1 Local storage by default</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Veritell is designed so that your Health Data and associated AI summaries are stored in an encrypted
                data store on your device, with encryption keys managed via your operating system's keychain or
                similar secure mechanism where available. This local-first design is intended to minimize how often
                your sensitive Health Data needs to leave your device.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2 mt-4">5.2 Optional cloud-based features</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Certain optional features may rely on secure cloud services, such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3 space-y-1">
                <li>
                    Cloud-hosted AI models that process Health Data to generate summaries;

                <li>
                    Encrypted cloud backup or sync of your locally stored data;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optional telemetry or diagnostics that you choose to share with us for support.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">
                Where such features involve Health Data or PHI, we intend to use appropriately scoped safeguards
                (such as using HIPAA-eligible infrastructure under Business Associate Agreements, where applicable)
                and to clearly explain, within the feature or settings, what data is involved and how it is
                protected.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">
                You will have the choice whether to enable these cloud-related features, and you can generally
                continue using the core local functionality without them.
